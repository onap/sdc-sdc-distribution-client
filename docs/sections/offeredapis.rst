Offered APIs
============

The api javadocs for interfaces provided by the sdc distribution client can be compiled by building the project.

See :ref:`build steps<Build Steps>` for more information.

The javadocs can be then found under the ``sdc-distribution-client/target/apidocs`` folder.

The main interface that must be implemented by clients is the IConfiguration interface.

See the :ref:`configuration section<config>` configuration section for more details.
